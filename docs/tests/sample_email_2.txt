###Hello, product leaders!


=C2=A0

Happy New Year! January often feels like cracking open a new book. We don=
=E2=80=99t know yet exactly what the year is going to hold. Will it be a th=
riller? A comedy? Fingers crossed it won=E2=80=99t turn out to be a zombie =
apocalypse survival guide!


When we start with this metaphorical blank page in front of us, we can feel=
 hopeful that it will turn out to be a narrative where we feel fulfilled an=
d engaged in our work, inspired by our teams and the goals they=E2=80=99re =
working toward, and committed to our own professional growth and developmen=
t.


If you=E2=80=99re reading this newsletter, that means you=E2=80=99ve alread=
y carved some time for yourself on that last point, so you=E2=80=99re doing=
 a great job so far!


In this edition, we=E2=80=99re diving deep into annual reviews and the broa=
der topic of reflection. How can you remove the administrative burden of re=
views and make them more meaningful for everyone involved?


As always, in addition to everything I=E2=80=99ve just mentioned, you=E2=80=
=99ll find plenty of other articles, videos, and the usual range of product=
 leadership resources to explore.


###Beyond HR Forms: A Product Leader=E2=80=99s Guide to Running Better Annu=
al Reviews


The main topic for this edition of the newsletter is annual reviews. And si=
nce this newsletter goes out in January, I bet half of you have already don=
e yours for last year and the other half still have them coming up. So yes,=
 dedicating this edition to annual reviews is=E2=80=A6 tricky. But I though=
t it was still worth doing.


Why? Because even if you=E2=80=99ve just filed your forms with HR and wrapp=
ed all your 1:1 conversations, you might still benefit from taking an hones=
t look at how you did them. A small reflection now can make next year=E2=80=
=99s reviews far more impactful. And if your reviews are still ahead of you=
=E2=80=94even better.


####=E2=AD=90 Annual reviews shouldn=E2=80=99t be the only time your people=
 get feedback

If you=E2=80=99ve read=C2=A0*STRONG Product People*, you already know this =
is one of the core principles I stand by. (And if you have not, the chapter=
 on feedback is available as a=C2=A0[free downloadable resource here](https=
://f2xm1.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dINmNvd1DF12w7HY26S/Avsk_RP=
u8pEL)).=C2=A0**A once-a-year feedback cycle is never enough to support gro=
wth.**=C2=A0Our PMs=E2=80=94and frankly all employees=E2=80=94need more fre=
quent nudges, guidance, and clarity than a single formal conversation can p=
rovide.


The ideal scenario: delivering praise and criticism constantly


But here=E2=80=99s the reality I see in many coaching engagements: Annual r=
eview season is the=C2=A0*only*=C2=A0moment when some people finally receiv=
e well-prepared, role-specific, structured feedback from their manager.


That=E2=80=99s why=E2=80=94if this is the moment your company formalizes=E2=
=80=94you need to make it count.


####=F0=9F=8E=AF Most HR frameworks are role-agnostic. Your feedback should=
n=E2=80=99t be.

HR forms are designed to work for multiple functions: Finance, Marketing, E=
ngineering, Product=E2=80=A6 They are useful, but they are=C2=A0**not**=C2=
=A0specific enough for product roles to be the sole framework you should us=
e to prepare for your sessions.


If you want the review to be meaningful, layer a role-specific lens on top.


That means:


-=20

Reviewing your PM=E2=80=99s impact=C2=A0*as a product manager*, not just as=
 an =E2=80=9Cemployee.=E2=80=9D


-=20

Assessing discovery work, stakeholder management, prioritization, decision-=
making, crisp communication, and contribution to team culture.


-=20

Grounding your feedback in real examples of product practices, helping them=
 see where their craft is strong=E2=80=94and where they might need to close=
 a skill gap or even need extra support.


And yes: Using a clear structure helps enormously. Whether it=E2=80=99s my=
=C2=A0[PMwheel](https://f2xm1.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/6rqJfgq8dIPRQN=
vAhYQariPTfPU/qblV8GkVmjl3), your own rubric, or another role-specific mode=
l, choose something and stick with it.


####A simple way to strengthen your annual review practice

If you=E2=80=99re still preparing for your upcoming reviews, or want to mak=
e next year smoother, here are a few reflections you can start with.


**=F0=9F=92=9A Are you remembering the human side of your employee?**


This may sound like a ridiculous thing to say, but hear me out: Sometimes w=
hen we=E2=80=99re deeply involved in the technical process of annual review=
s, we forget to think about our employees as human beings. So it=E2=80=99s =
important to **make sure you understand their hopes and dreams for the futu=
re**. If you haven=E2=80=99t already carved out time to have this type of b=
ig picture conversation with your team members, consider this a sign to do =
so!


=F0=9F=92=A1=C2=A0**Have you given enough feedback throughout the year?**


If not, what lightweight rituals could you introduce to make it easier? (We=
ekly quick feedback, quarterly check-ins, etc.) And remember:=C2=A0**Feedba=
ck requires awareness**.=C2=A0Make it a habit to actively look for moments =
to praise people, not just moments to correct their mistakes. Keep a simple=
 place (a note on your phone, a doc, your Claude code repo, whatever works =
for you) to capture both positive observations and opportunities for growth=
. This way, when your next =E2=80=9Cmini feedback=E2=80=9D touchpoint comes=
 around, you aren=E2=80=99t relying on memory alone.


**Do you have a shared language for discussing product skills in your org?*=
*


A=C2=A0[craft-based framework](https://f2xm1.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh=
/6rqJfgq8dIR6SqDKBrq8nJXPIiW/nxKGWaKEP0ru)=C2=A0like the PMwheel can make c=
onversations much clearer. This also ensures that everyone involved in the =
feedback process=E2=80=94the person who is being reviewed as well as the ma=
nager or peer who is reviewing them=E2=80=94is using consistent criteria an=
d limiting bias from this process.


**=F0=9F=94=8D Are both of you bringing 360-degree feedback into the conver=
sation=E2=80=94and do you have a system that makes this easy?**


Annual reviews get much richer when both leader and PM talk to a small set =
of peers, stakeholders, or cross-functional partners. To make this predicta=
ble and easy to schedule, put a simple rule in place. For example: Both of =
you pick three people, align on who they are, and inform them upfront. Ever=
yone knows why these conversations are happening and gets time blocked on t=
heir calendars. Ideally, this becomes a company-wide habit rather than a pe=
rsonal workaround=E2=80=94one that makes getting on people=E2=80=99s calend=
ars less of a hassle.


**And are you turning those insights into clear, role-specific examples?**


When you have structured 360-degree input, it becomes much easier to pinpoi=
nt real behaviors. For example: =E2=80=9CSeveral stakeholders mentioned tha=
t in recent review meetings, your storytelling wasn=E2=80=99t strong enough=
 to help Sales and Marketing understand why the team worked on a specific i=
nitiative=E2=80=94or how they could contribute to its success.=E2=80=9D Spe=
cific examples like this turn vague feedback into something your PM can act=
ually act on.


**Are you evaluating your PM=E2=80=99s actual time distribution?**


Many PMs think they spend the majority of their time on important work like=
 discovery, but their calendars tell a different story.


####=F0=9F=93=9D Still ahead of your annual reviews? Borrow this structure:


1. Make sure you check in about their larger hopes and dreams from time to =
time (these conversations are a time for larger self-reflection for your te=
am members, too).=20
2.=20

Start with strengths (product-specific ones!).


3.=20

Reflect on impact, not effort.


4.=20

Clarify skill gaps using a role-based model.


5.=20

Discuss time distribution=E2=80=94what they actually spent their days and w=
eeks on.


6.=20

Agree on 2=E2=80=933 development focus areas with clear =E2=80=9Clearning h=
eadlines.=E2=80=9D (If you are lacking structure here, you could use the=C2=

q8dISlVIVTgBFgiufKw1Y/DJAujipH6Rr-)).


7.=20

Close with encouragement and commit to ongoing support and regular check-in=
s.


####And if you=E2=80=99ve already completed your reviews=E2=80=A6 reflect a=
nyway

Ask yourself:


-=20

What worked well in my review conversations?


-=20

Where did I feel underprepared?


-=20

Which parts of the role were hardest to evaluate?


-=20

What feedback did I avoid giving? Why?


-=20

What structures or habits do I need to build earlier in the year?


And here=E2=80=99s a big one for many product leaders:=C2=A0**How much time=
 did the whole preparation actually take=E2=80=94and where did the time go?=
=C2=A0**Annual reviews often feel painful not because of the conversation, =
but because the preparation is so heavy. So reflect on the breakdown. Where=
 did you spend the majority of your time?


-=20

Was it gathering examples?


-=20

Was it digging through your notes?


-=20

Was it coordinating 360-degree conversations?


-=20

Or was it some internal process overhead that really shouldn=E2=80=99t be t=
his hard?


Some effort is valuable=E2=80=94for example, having real conversations with=
 peers and stakeholders. But if you=E2=80=99re losing hours to admin, messy=
 templates, unclear expectations, or =E2=80=9Cplease fill out this long for=
m in three different tools,=E2=80=9D that=E2=80=99s system overhead you can=
 (and should) challenge, escalate, or help improve ahead of next year.


And finally:=C2=A0**What habits do I need to build earlier in the year to m=
ake this easier next time?**


Because the leaders who give feedback regularly and keep simple notes along=
 the way rarely dread annual review season. They walk into these conversati=
ons prepared, grounded, and confident. The work is distributed across the y=
ear, not squeezed into one frantic December (or January!) afternoon.

###Upskilling and Reflection Ideas

Given the timing of this newsletter, I imagine you're either deep in annual=
 review mode or you've just completed yours. We already covered some more s=
tructured approaches to reflection in the intro (and I'll share a few more =
at the end of this newsletter).=C2=A0


If all this reflection has you thinking about ways you might want to improv=
e your leadership skills or help your team members develop specific aspects=
 of their product craft, here are a few specific steps you can take:

ctice by signing up for my email course,=C2=A0[From STRONG to Exceptional: =

###What's new with *STRONG Product People*?


=C2=A0


####What I=E2=80=99m up to these days


It=E2=80=99s been so exciting to see product leaders commit to their growth=
 by signing up for From STRONG to Exceptional. And over the next few weeks,=
 we=E2=80=99re going to be starting our quarterly AMA calls, where particip=
ants get to share their wins and challenges, get personalized tips and advi=
ce from me, and connect with peers who are on the same journey.

**Happy birthday to=C2=A0*****STRONG Product People*****!**


My first book,=C2=A0*STRONG Product People*=C2=A0just celebrated its fifth =
birthday. For five years now, it=E2=80=99s been on your desks, your shelves=
, or in your backpacks, providing actionable insights into managing your pr=
oduct team to its fullest potential. One of my favorite things since publis=
hing this book has been chatting to you about it in person, either at my co=
rporate book clubs or when I meet you at events. Please never stop sharing =
your insights and takeaways with me!


**The =F0=9F=A7=AD PMwheel in action******I love seeing how people use my t=
ools in their day-to-day work, and=C2=A0[this post](https://f2xm1.r.ag.d.se=

Lisa Marie Reidt, Product @ SAG Digital, made me especially happy. She shar=
es how the PMwheel helped spark clearer conversations around role expectati=
ons and opened the door to more intentional growth discussions.


**Finally diving into Claude Code**

I finally found the time to set up Claude Code (mainly to improve my conten=
t creation). Teresa Torres and Andrew Skotzko had a big influence on gettin=
g me to finally make room for it and push it to the top of my to-do list. =
=F0=9F=98=89


While this is more about how I'm operating my business rather than a strict=
ly product leadership topic, let me know if it's something you'd like me to=
 share more about in the future.

###Before You Leave - Last Note: My personal way to reflect=E2=80=94and how=
 to find yours


The last few weeks I found myself doing what I do every year around this ti=
me: reflecting on the past 12 months and looking ahead to the next.


For me, that reflection takes the form of a blog post. I sit down, I write =
it all out=E2=80=94the highs, the lows, the unexpected turns=E2=80=94and I =
share it publicly. (If you're curious,[=C2=A0you can read this year's refle=
ction here](https://f2xm1.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/SMK1E8tHeGZoeUVOCJ=
IjdcW94xFw/eNwZFhFqkcpA).)


But here's the thing: My way isn't the only way.


Some people flip through their physical calendar, month by month, rememberi=
ng what happened when. Others open their "what I'm grateful for" jar and re=
ad through slips of paper they collected throughout the year. (Of course, t=
his method assumes you already have the jar and you=E2=80=99ve been adding =
to it all year!) Some meet with a close friend over coffee and talk through=
 it together.


There's no single "right" way to reflect.=C2=A0**What matters is that you D=
O it**=E2=80=94that you create space to pause, to notice what shaped you, a=
nd to think about what comes next.


**So here's my question for you as we head into 2026: What is your way of r=
eflecting?**


If you don't have a ritual yet, maybe this is the year to start one. Find a=
 few=C2=A0[good questions](https://f2xm1.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/SMK=
1E8tHeGgg6dKLNTSDjRot3FqC/eiqwfp8nwPXV). Make them your own. Create the rit=
ual around it (grab a cup of coffee, light a candle, whatever puts you in a=
 reflective mood!). And see what you learn about yourself in the process.


Wishing you a meaningful start to 2026!


**P.S.**=C2=A0I work with Melissa Suzuno on my newsletter, blog, and other =
written content. If you're looking for support with any of your writing, yo=

 make this predictable and easy to schedule, put a simple rule in place. Fo=

 them upfront. Everyone knows why these conversations are happening and get=
s time blocked on their calendars. Ideally, this becomes a company-wide hab=
it rather than a personal workaround=E2=80=94one that makes getting on peop=
